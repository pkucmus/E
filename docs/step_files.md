# STEP Files

The moment you've been waiting for is here - I'm releasing the source. Please remember that it's done under the [GPL-3.0 License](https://github.com/pkucmus/EVA/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Using Onshape

Each release takes way too much work and if I was to export all STEP files I would go crazy - to get step files go to source: [Onshape EVA document](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/1cea28d26150bba34a3d6614/v/b7d798bcab110a3f0ba9ead1/e/1ed71cfade3ccdcb05272d50).

There you will find every part that was ever created. Use the bottom bar to navigate:

Also have in mind the "configuration feature" I use - in the top left corner you will find different variants of some parts:
