Mainstream support fouses on Rat Rig 3D printers but it's customizable enough to support different systems. If you are looking for guidance after you decided to use EVA Getting started is probably what you are looking for. Rather lenghty video descriptions can be found on the YouTube playlist . Download \u00b6 This manual is full of links to specific parts, but there is no need to download those one by one the full repository can be downloaded as a ZIP file . MGN12 and MGN15 \u00b6 All listed assemblies are pointing to MGN15 variants but a smaller (and probably better) MGN12 variant is now also available. MGN12 is lighter so it's a good choice for a CoreXY system to make the X rail assembly lighter. Both variants are fully compatible with each other, which means that you only need to change the MGN rail, your top and bottom parts and you are set. Examples \u00b6 For Rat Rig V-core Pro the Easy Mod is required to change the X and Y rail orientation. EVA is now officially used by Rat Rig in their products : V-core Pro (with Easy Mod) V-cast Contribution \u00b6 Issues, problems, feature requests, requests for compatibility with different printers can be requested in the project's issue tracker . Attributions \u00b6 One does not need a keen eye to see that this design is based on many different designs that are out in the wild - although all the parts here are made from scratch - their authors deserve credit (their work provided inspiration): Rat Rig for making the V-core which is the perfect sanbox for building and modding a 3D Printer pekcitron for the Prusa Bear Upgrade BLV and his amazing BLV mgn cube The following people deserve special credit for their amazing work - making some of the parts, providing guidance, testing parts, keeping me in check. Their input was a huge help so please do me a favor and check out their work: Olof Ogland Simon Davie Jo\u00e3o Barros THANK YOU!

Sub assemblies are built out of different printed, hardware and electronic parts. A complete EVA carriage is built out of 4 major parts: front - which is the main part differentiating which hotend variant is used top - with the front may differ from variant to variant, also changes for different MGN sizes bottom - first of all, changes from MGN sizes but then may differ for different fans back - with fronts the most complex part - changes for different motion systems (Cartesian, IDEX, CoreXY) Then there are extra parts like: cable holders tension sliders - those depend on the back used probe holders layer cooling How to pick your parts? \u00b6 I understand there are lots of parts and that maybe confusing but it really boils down to a few decisions that you probably made at this point. Front - Extruders \u00b6 The front part is quite obviously the most vivid piece when it comes to different extruders so the selection of the front part should be easy enough. The V6 faces use an additional part that holds a 40mm fan. BMG BMG face uses the face_v6 part since it's mounting is handled by the top part. Long screw direction Notice how on the front heavy (Aero and Hemera) faces the screws are threaded from the back. Tops \u00b6 The first decision is most likely already made, MGN12 vs MGN15. Then there's the plain top and the special BMG top. Bottoms \u00b6 Simillarly to tops those are nothing special - the duct extension length is the only thing that's different from one variant to another. That length depends on the MGN variant and different faces. They marked as either short or long. Backs - Motion system \u00b6 If you are looking to use EVA on a CoreXY device you need to look for the back_corexy stl files. Pick the fan angle you need - 60deg is the default but 90deg saves most space in Y, where in some cases the 30deg anged fan can fit under the frame thus providing more space in Y. Those backs require the M5 tension sliders. The Cartesian and IDEX backs are simillar - to be honest the Cartesian back is just a simplified IDEX back. Those use the M3 tensions sliders - those sliders are not easy to work with, can swell in the back part but work. Extras \u00b6 Cable Holders \u00b6 In version 1.3.0 cable holders were moved from the top to the back (although some tops may still, coincidentally have a place for a cable holder). There are two variants, one leading the cables to the back (mostly suitable for Cartesians) and the universal one. Tension Sliders \u00b6 If you have a 6mm belt based printer or the orientation of the teeth on your belts are diffreent then look for different sliders - there's quite a few provided: Mirror and flip You'll find 4 different variants for each slider. flip have the teeth on a different face and mirror are just mirrored. Bed probes \u00b6 EVA platform follows a simple standard for different bed probe mounts. Each carriage has 2 vertically alligned M3 screw holes, 8mm apart. All probe mounts follow this standard but there are special veriants of probes where a probe mount had to be modified to fit a carriage (i.e. BL-Touch on the Aero Assembly have the thick name). Layer Cooling \u00b6 Horns Duct \u00b6 Since version 1.2.0 EVA has support for Volcano hot ends. Notice the ones called risen - those have a higier tolerance if you'll run into issues with the standard ones (the tips are moved 1mm more from the bed): RHD \u00b6 In 1.3.0 a MK3 RHD Fan Duct Rev. C remix was added, it does not have a Volcano variant but is narrower than Horns Duct which maybe important for an IDEX assembly Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) \u00b6 The Horns Duct v2 project is now a part of the EVA platform. I get a lot of questions around the performance of the layer cooling. I can't give you more than subjective promises and the result of a simulation I did for the EVA platform: Info the air on the inlet was calibrated to a Sunon MF50151VX-B00U-A99 radial fan and the 60deg version of the back","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"getting_started/#getting-started","text":"EVA is very modular - this means that the final carriage assembly is achieved by picking a proper set of sub assemblies.
